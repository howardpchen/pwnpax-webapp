# pwnpax-webapp

Vulnerable webapp project

Accepted as Abstract for 2020 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

Note: To use this, you'd probably also need an actual DICOM endpoint such as Orthanc installed, which is not included in this repository.

## Spoiler Alert

While in a real life setting an attacker should get to use whatever resource (within reason) at their disposal, this GitHub repository is not meant to be part of that resource.  

In other words, you would be able to see things in this code - including flags - that allow you to bypass some vulnerability testing exercise.  If that is not what you want to do, then avoid reading the codes. :)

## Licensing

Based on [Capricorn](https://github.com/howardpchen/capricorn) project, which was under GPL 3.  Therefore, PwnPax is also GPL3
